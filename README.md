Exercise 7: An expression is a set of terms combined using the operations +, –, x or (div), for example [& (4x − 3) or (x^2 – xy + 17)&]. An equation states that two expressions are equal in value, for example (4b − 2 = 6). An identity is a statement that is true no matter what values are chosen, for example (4a times a^2 = 4a^3).

Exercise 7 : The text explains three mathematical concepts: expressions, equations, and identities. An expression is a combination of terms using operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x), or division (÷). For example, (4x − 3) or (x^2 – xy + 17) are expressions.

An equation states that two expressions are equal in value. For example, 4b − 2 = 6 is an equation where the expressions 4b − 2 and 6 are equal in value.

An identity is a statement that is true no matter what values are chosen. For example, 4a times a^2 = 4a^3 is an identity because it is true for all values of a.

Identities can be written with the sign ≡1.

#EXCERSISE 8: Define the numbers to multiply and add
num1 = 3
num2 = 4;
​
# Multiply the numbers
​
product = num1 * num2;
​
# Add the numbers
sum = num1 + num2;
​
# Print the results
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {product}")
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum}")
The product of 3 and 4 is 12
The sum of 3 and 4 is 7
